            <p>So far as post-flood relief and rehabilitation of the poor and others are concerned, the best way to
                serve public interests is to make arrangement for pure drinking water, oral saline, medical camps and
                some common medicines to fight water-borne diseases. If the reconstruction and repair of roads and
                bridges are started soon after recession of waters, the working class people made more vulnerable now
                will have some means of income. So here is an area to reap a double benefit from. Last but not least,
                the floods this time may be a prelude to more such natural calamities occurring all across the world on
                account of climate change. Let there be enough preparation for such damage and disasters.</p><br>
